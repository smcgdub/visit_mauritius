## **1. User Experience (UX)**

### **1.1 Target Audience**

####  This website is aimed at anyone who:

* 

### **1.2 Visitor goals** 

*  

### **1.3 Business goals**

* 

### **1.4 User Stories**


### **1.5 Design choices**

#### FONTS

* On this project i decided to use the Google font [Arapey](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arapey?query=Arapey#standard-styles)
* Arapey (Ah-ra-pay) is a contemporary modern typeface with some features of a Bodoni, but the structures, soft lines, and finishes leave a calm and distinguished feeling. The first sketches were made during a vacation in Arapey, a small town the north of Uruguay. The italics are gentle, rhythmic, and bring a special glamour to both text use and titles.

#### ICONS

* I also decided i would use [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)icons throughout the site. I did this because i believe icons make a site look better and also give the user an idea of the type of information that they are looking at.
* I also used font awesome for the companies social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn) located in the footer of the page. 

#### COLOURS
